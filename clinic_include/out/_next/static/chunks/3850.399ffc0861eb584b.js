Equations","content":"A quadratic equation has a double root when it can be factored into a perfect square, meaning both roots are the same. This occurs if the coefficient of the linear term, when halved and squared, equals the constant term. For example, $x^2−8x+16=0$ factors into $(x−4)^2=0$, showing a double root at $x=4$.","lecture_type_title":"백과사전","lecture_type":"opt-lec-dic","updated_at":"2024-12-30T22:15:21.046468","lecture_vod_set":[{"id":1527,"code":"VOD0000001527","title":"Double Root of Quadratic Equations","teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560036520-ld7m4me4jx.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735561245938-9hahipftufe.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1528,"code":"VOD0000001528","title":"Double Root of Quadratic Equations","teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560036520-ld7m4me4jx.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735561245938-9hahipftufe.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1529,"code":"VOD0000001529","title":"Double Root of Quadratic Equations","teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560036520-ld7m4me4jx.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735561245938-9hahipftufe.mp4","master_video_url":"https://vod.dx5.xyz/vod/lecture/1735561245938-9hahipftufe/1735561245938-9hahipftufe.m3u8","video_main_playtime":187}],"valid_thumbnail":false,"valid_video":false,"valid_keywords":true,"valid_quizzes":false}]},{"highlight_set":[],"keyword_set":[{"chapter":[{"code":"ENG001-GRD003-SEM001-BIG002-MID003-SML006-SU009","title":"Various Formulas Used in Quadratic Equations","level":6,"parent":"ENG001-GRD003-SEM001-BIG002-MID003-SML006","parent_title":"Solving Quadratic Equations"}],"keyword_type_title":"개념 키워드","created_by":null,"updated_by":"최영준","keyword_audit_updated_by":null,"variations":[{"id":1044,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","teacher_name":"상준","teacher_id":1,"variation_content":"<p>If the discriminant ($\\\\textrm{D}$) of a quadratic equation equals $0$, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals $0$.</p>","variation_preset":"<p>If the discriminant (D) of a quadratic equation equals zero, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals zero.</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/sangjun-2c728c33-c2b2-498e-89cc-523f155c9bb7.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null},{"id":1045,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","teacher_name":"태린","teacher_id":2,"variation_content":"<p>If the discriminant ($\\\\textrm{D}$) of a quadratic equation equals $0$, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals $0$.</p>","variation_preset":"<p>If the discriminant (D) of a quadratic equation equals zero, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals zero.</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/taerin-b2293b34-c101-4631-8f34-7c08f7b28dc7.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null},{"id":1046,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","teacher_name":"석희","teacher_id":3,"variation_content":"<p>If the discriminant ($\\\\textrm{D}$) of a quadratic equation equals $0$, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals $0$.</p>","variation_preset":"<p>If the discriminant, denoted as D, of a quadratic equation equals zero, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals zero.</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/seokhee-e62f24f3-efe2-4493-8636-9f5ecdf9c15f.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null}],"code":"KWD0000002321","title":"Determining Double Root Based on Sign of Discriminant of Quadratic Equations","content":"<p>If the discriminant ($\\\\textrm{D}$) of a quadratic equation equals $0$, it has a double root, which can be identified when the part inside the square root in the quadratic formula equals $0$.</p>","tip":"<p>In the quadratic formula, when the part inside the square root equals $0$.</p>","created_at":"2024-12-20T10:55:54.308494","updated_at":"2025-01-01T20:58:35.913971","keyword_audit_updated_at":null,"keyword_audit":"NOT_YET","keyword_type":"opt-kwd-typ-ntn"}],"option_set":[],"variations":[{"id":3709,"teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","variation_content":"<p>When this is the case, what is the value of its discriminant?
