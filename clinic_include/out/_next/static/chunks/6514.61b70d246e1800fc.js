Understanding this simplifies solving equations efficiently.","lecture_type_title":"백과사전","lecture_type":"opt-lec-dic","updated_at":"2024-12-30T22:00:11.236283","lecture_vod_set":[{"id":1413,"code":"VOD0000001413","title":"Properties of Equations","teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735559556833-3ryy5arr33r.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735559987119-wmil730f14.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1414,"code":"VOD0000001414","title":"Properties of Equations","teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735559556833-3ryy5arr33r.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735559987119-wmil730f14.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1415,"code":"VOD0000001415","title":"Properties of Equations","teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735559556833-3ryy5arr33r.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735559987119-wmil730f14.mp4","master_video_url":"https://vod.dx5.xyz/vod/lecture/1735559987119-wmil730f14/1735559987119-wmil730f14.m3u8","video_main_playtime":303}],"valid_thumbnail":false,"valid_video":false,"valid_keywords":true,"valid_quizzes":false}]},{"highlight_set":[],"keyword_set":[{"chapter":[{"code":"ENG001-GRD003-SEM001-BIG002-MID002-SML004-SU005","title":"Factorization Formulas","level":6,"parent":"ENG001-GRD003-SEM001-BIG002-MID002-SML004","parent_title":"Factorization"}],"keyword_type_title":"개념 키워드","created_by":null,"updated_by":"권수빈","keyword_audit_updated_by":null,"variations":[{"id":984,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","teacher_name":"상준","teacher_id":1,"variation_content":"<p>The factorization formula $x^2+(a+b)x+ab=(x+a)(x+b)$ expresses the product of two linear expressions where the coefficient of $x$ is $1$;
