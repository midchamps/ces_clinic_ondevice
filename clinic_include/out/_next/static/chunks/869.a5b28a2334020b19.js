Using diagrams, we explored how the theorem can be proven by comparing areas of squares formed around the triangle. The key takeaway is to remember the equation \\n$a^2+b^2=c^2$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse.","lecture_type_title":"백과사전","lecture_type":"opt-lec-dic","updated_at":"2024-12-30T22:26:18.719057","lecture_vod_set":[{"id":1548,"code":"VOD0000001548","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","thumbnail_url":"assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1549,"code":"VOD0000001549","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","thumbnail_url":"assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1550,"code":"VOD0000001550","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","thumbnail_url":"assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":304}],"valid_thumbnail":false,"valid_video":false,"valid_keywords":true,"valid_quizzes":false}]},{"highlight_set":[],"keyword_set":[{"chapter":[],"keyword_type_title":"개념 키워드","created_by":null,"updated_by":null,"keyword_audit_updated_by":null,"code":"KWD0000002091","title":"Calculation of Values to be Found","content":"Calculate all required values","tip":"Make sure all the calculations are complete.","created_at":"2024-12-20T10:55:34.845261","updated_at":"2024-12-20T10:55:34.845271","keyword_audit_updated_at":null,"keyword_audit":"NOT_YET","keyword_type":"opt-kwd-typ-ntn"}],"option_set":[],"variations":[{"id":3685,"teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","variation_content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l ^ 2 $, right?</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Now, you can find the value of l squared, right?</p>","tts":"assets/clinic/sangjun-9cfa0617-746f-4b41-9d18-d4577a6713d8.mp3","error_msg":null,"variation_status":"SUCCESS","tts_status":"SUCCESS"},{"id":3686,"teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","variation_content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l ^ 2 $, right?</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Now, you can find the value of l squared, right?</p>","tts":"assets/clinic/taerin-c5781c7e-9390-4cdd-9ed7-ea4eb8f84413.mp3","error_msg":null,"variation_status":"SUCCESS","tts_status":"SUCCESS"},{"id":3687,"teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","variation_content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l ^ 2 $, right?</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Now, you can find the value of l squared, right?</p>","tts":"assets/clinic/seokhee-98e0acea-29b2-4fbb-b02d-d05546f2c63f.mp3","error_msg":null,"variation_status":"SUCCESS","tts_status":"SUCCESS"}],"code":"CLD0000001848","shortcut_content":"<p></p>","option_type":"NONE","order":0,"content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l ^ 2 $, right?</p>","depth":"C","group_name":"G-010","clinic_type":"DE","type_index":26,"parent":null,"tag_set":[],"clip_set":[{"id":86,"code":"LEC0000000086","title":"Concept of Finding","content":"In math, \\"find\\" means to determine the answer to what the problem is asking, typically stated at the end.
