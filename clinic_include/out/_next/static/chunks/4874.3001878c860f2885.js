Using diagrams, we explored how the theorem can be proven by comparing areas of squares formed around the triangle. The key takeaway is to remember the equation \\n$a^2+b^2=c^2$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse.","lecture_type_title":"백과사전","lecture_type":"opt-lec-dic","updated_at":"2024-12-30T22:26:18.719057","lecture_vod_set":[{"id":1548,"code":"VOD0000001548","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1549,"code":"VOD0000001549","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1550,"code":"VOD0000001550","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":"https://vod.dx5.xyz/vod/lecture/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.m3u8","video_main_playtime":304}],"valid_thumbnail":false,"valid_video":false,"valid_keywords":true,"valid_quizzes":false}]},{"highlight_set":[],"keyword_set":[{"chapter":[],"keyword_type_title":"개념 키워드","created_by":null,"updated_by":"최영준","keyword_audit_updated_by":null,"variations":[{"id":354,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","teacher_name":"상준","teacher_id":1,"variation_content":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/sangjun-66b4d491-3752-4e94-97cf-7622c02ad783.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null},{"id":355,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","teacher_name":"태린","teacher_id":2,"variation_content":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/taerin-61ce2df6-9e03-484d-91fd-591eca873de2.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null},{"id":356,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","teacher_name":"석희","teacher_id":3,"variation_content":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/seokhee-63cb874f-c8e9-4a50-a4b0-46343f976b40.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null}],"code":"KWD0000002091","title":"Calculation of Values to be Found","content":"<p>Ensure all values are correctly calculated and check every step</p>","tip":"<p>Make sure all the calculations are complete.</p>","created_at":"2024-12-20T10:55:34.845261","updated_at":"2025-01-01T19:40:50.226223","keyword_audit_updated_at":null,"keyword_audit":"NOT_YET","keyword_type":"opt-kwd-typ-ntn"}],"option_set":[],"variations":[{"id":6214,"teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","variation_content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l^2$, right?</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Now, you can find the value of l squared, right?</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/sangjun-f65b8b5a-12ae-4bbf-b854-dc93b1dd24bd.mp3","error_msg":null,"variation_status":"SUCCESS","tts_status":"SUCCESS"},{"id":6215,"teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","variation_content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l^2$, right?</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Now, you can find the value of l squared, right?</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/taerin-ebf662bf-1c15-400b-97d2-a4dd170a8a3e.mp3","error_msg":null,"variation_status":"SUCCESS","tts_status":"SUCCESS"},{"id":6216,"teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","variation_content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l^2$, right?</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Now, you can find the value of l squared, right?</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/seokhee-46348c05-2943-4091-b630-048c9b2cede1.mp3","error_msg":null,"variation_status":"SUCCESS","tts_status":"SUCCESS"}],"code":"CLD0000005391","shortcut_content":"<p></p>","option_type":"NONE","order":999,"content":"<p>Now, you can find the value of $l^2$, right?</p>","depth":"C","group_name":"G-010","clinic_type":"DE","type_index":25,"parent":null,"tag_set":[],"clip_set":[{"id":86,"code":"LEC0000000086","title":"Concept of Finding","content":"In math, \\"find\\" means to determine the answer to what the problem is asking, typically stated at the end.
