Theorem","content":"Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Using diagrams, we explored how the theorem can be proven by comparing areas of squares formed around the triangle. The key takeaway is to remember the equation \\n$a^2+b^2=c^2$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse.","lecture_type_title":"백과사전","lecture_type":"opt-lec-dic","updated_at":"2024-12-30T22:26:18.719057","lecture_vod_set":[{"id":1548,"code":"VOD0000001548","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1549,"code":"VOD0000001549","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":2,"teacher_name":"태린","teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":0},{"id":1550,"code":"VOD0000001550","title":"Pythagorean Theorem","teacher_id":3,"teacher_name":"석희","teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","thumbnail_url":"/assets/clinic/1735560577990-hlx3govtw3q.png","video_url":"/assets/clinic/1735562741954-xqljcmaqxbk.mp4","master_video_url":null,"video_main_playtime":304}],"valid_thumbnail":false,"valid_video":false,"valid_keywords":true,"valid_quizzes":false}]},{"highlight_set":[],"keyword_set":[{"chapter":[{"code":"ENG001-GRD003-SEM001-BIG002-MID003-SML006-SU007","title":"Solving Quadratic Equations","level":6,"parent":"ENG001-GRD003-SEM001-BIG002-MID003-SML006","parent_title":"Solving Quadratic Equations"}],"keyword_type_title":"개념 키워드","created_by":null,"updated_by":"염승규","keyword_audit_updated_by":null,"variations":[{"id":1014,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","teacher_name":"상준","teacher_id":1,"variation_content":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting $ax^2 + c = 0$ as $x^2 = k$ and solving by taking the square root of $k$, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting a times x squared plus c equals zero as x squared equals k and solving by taking the square root of k, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/sangjun-adf48711-276a-42a1-9966-75e4812147de.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null},{"id":1015,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000002","teacher_name":"태린","teacher_id":2,"variation_content":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting $ax^2 + c = 0$ as $x^2 = k$ and solving by taking the square root of $k$, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting a x squared plus c equals zero as x squared equals k and solving by taking the square root of k, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/taerin-4372becd-068e-4cd6-8949-e5b0fa134e85.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null},{"id":1016,"teacher_code":"TCH0000000003","teacher_name":"석희","teacher_id":3,"variation_content":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting $ax^2 + c = 0$ as $x^2 = k$ and solving by taking the square root of $k$, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","variation_preset":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting a x squared plus c equals zero as x squared equals k and solving by taking the square root of k, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","tts":"/assets/clinic/seokhee-486fc5de-5bc2-4fc4-9e65-b8ab07f4e137.mp3","variation_status":"NOT_YET","tts_status":"SUCCESS","error_msg":null}],"code":"KWD0000002311","title":"Solving Quadratic Equations Using Square Roots.","content":"<p>Solving quadratic equations using square roots involves rewriting $ax^2 + c = 0$ as $x^2 = k$ and solving by taking the square root of $k$, which is particularly convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","tip":"<p>It is convenient when there is no linear term.</p>","created_at":"2024-12-20T10:55:53.376564","updated_at":"2025-01-01T21:02:34.723648","keyword_audit_updated_at":null,"keyword_audit":"NOT_YET","keyword_type":"opt-kwd-typ-ntn"}],"option_set":[],"variations":[{"id":7522,"teacher_id":1,"teacher_name":"상준","teacher_code":"TCH0000000001","variation_content":"<p>Therefore, $\\\\overline{\\\\textrm{MP}}=12$.
